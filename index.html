<p>This project aims to develop a simple, concise and robust language for making bi-dimensional data tables.</p>
<p>This is the Iacchus’ Table Markup Language</p>
<h1 id="the-itml-language-specification">The ITML Language Specification</h1>
<p><em>(this is pre-alpha and is currently in development)</em></p>
<p>We are trying to follow the steps of simple languages like markdown and toml, which simply do their job well done and nothing else.</p>
<p>The ITML language is a simple and legible language, easy to learn, and writing with it goes in the natural process of writing text in a text editor: no more in drawing tables having to adjust the table columns when more text is added. In ITML you simply state the format and state the cols in the first block of text, and each subsequent line (or lines if we use indentation in an entry), or paragraphs (if we use space between indented text of the same cell), will be the contents of a table cell.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr.">TL; DR.</h2>
<p>ITML is a formatting language for making data tables, like in html for example.</p>
<p>The format has a header and a description of the columns at first, then the cells are written just after, one per line. If we have the need of spanning a cell on multiple lines, we use indentation.</p>
<p>These are the specification basics.</p>
<h2 id="the-table-header">The Table Header</h2>
<p>The first block of the stream (string or file) contains the string <code>itbl</code> and the names of all columns of the table, using shell-like escape, like this:</p>
<pre><code>itbl &quot;Column 1&quot; Column\ 2 Column3</code></pre>
<p>There will be three columns in this example. “Column 1”, “Column 2” and “Column3”. The backslash in ‘Column 2’ is used to escape espaces, so they don’t get splitted but instead are part of the same argument. As seen in ‘Column 1’, the quotation marks also can be used to escape spaces inside a column name, in a similar fashion as a POSIX command line shell interprets arguments.</p>
<p>If more space is needed, so to not break the max line width of 79 chars we can continue the header after one or more an idented newlines. Like this</p>
<pre><code>itbl &quot;This is the name of the first column&quot; &quot;This is the name of the third
    column&quot; &quot;And this indented line let us span our table heading definition
    for as much lines as we need&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The above signature creates a table with three columns.</p>
<h2 id="the-table-body">The Table Body</h2>
<p><strong>After the header, each new line with indentation 0 (not indented) will be treated as table cell.</strong></p>
<p>If the line needs to be broken in various lines, the line continuation will be syntatically representing by adding indentation to the broken lines, this is, by adding spaces before the characters in the new broken lines. The amount of spaces if not actually enforced, but it is enforced that multiple indented lines have the same amount of spaces than the indented line before. Example:</p>
<pre><code>itbl COLUMN1 COLUMN2 COLUMN3  # then we have 3 columns

This is the first column of the table, and we will break this line and indent,
    it, so that we dont break our formatting rule of not trespassing the number
    of 79 characters per line. See how the multiple lines indented have the
    same indentation: this is an enforced rule. If the number of spaces differ
    from one to other, it is a bug and the itml file should not pass the
    preprocessing phase.
This is a cell in the second column. Now we are going to show that we do not
  need to have the same indentation as before, but we SHOULD always use the
  same indentation. This is not enforced for the time being, but we should 
  attain to some standards for formatting our itml files. We are thinking if we
  should use 2 or 4 spaces. Very probably we will stick with 4 spaces, as
  any modern text editor is capable of shifting a tab for 4 spaces and then
  automatically keep the indentation on the following lines, and 4 spaces
  improve readability of the itbl source.
And this is a cell in the third column.</code></pre>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Comments in the <code>itbl</code> specification can be added to files by prepending the character <code>#</code> to the comment. There are basically two types of comments, which are: in empty lines and after text</p>
<h3 id="comments-in-empty-lines">Comments in empty lines</h3>
<pre><code>This is a line of text representing a cell

  # and this is a comment in an empty line
And this represents another cell</code></pre>
<h3 id="comments-after-text">Comments after text</h3>
<pre><code>This is a line of text representing a cell  # and this is a comment after text</code></pre>
<p>Comment lines and inline comments are removed from the data at preprocessing time, so they don’t get to the ITML processor.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-rules">Formatting rules</h2>
<p>One of the caracteristics which we have in mind as we develop the ITML-lang is readability from the very <code>itbl</code> source.</p>
<p>SO, we will try to attain to best practices in writing the source so that we respect some rules, even these rules not being enforced by the ITML specification.</p>
<p>Some of these rules we are borrowing from the Python language, which uses indentation syntatically as well and have being proven to be good through the time and use.</p>
<h3 id="max-width-of-79-characters-per-line">Max width of 79 characters per line</h3>
<p>The ITBL format lines should have the maximum of 79 characters per line. Additional characters should be broken to the next line and indented.</p>
<h3 id="spaces-indentation-without-tabs">4 spaces indentation without tabs</h3>
<p>The ITBL format indentation should not use TAB, and should be indented with 2 or 4 spaces, concisely. After pre-alpha we will see which case is better and change this documentation with the urging to use 2 or 4 spaces, which be better.</p>
<h3 id="empty-line-after-n-columns-cells">Empty line after n-columns cells</h3>
<p>The lines representing the cells of one row in the ITML format should have an empty line after the number of columns. Simple like this:</p>
<pre><code>itbl COLUMN1 COLUMN2 COLUMN3  # then we have 3 columns

This text is the first column. 
This text is the second column. 
This text is the third column.

After the newline, this is the first column of the second row.
And this is the second column of the second row.
And this is the last(3rd) column of the second row.</code></pre>
<p>As seen above, after the three columns of the first row we add a blank line to improve readability of the source. The newline has no syntatic meaning, as we are all consenting adults here, but we enphsize this norm so to improve readability of the source code.</p>
<h3 id="two-spaces-before-in-inline-comments-just-after-the-lines-text">Two spaces before # in inline comments, just after the line’s text</h3>
<p>The inline comments in ITML format, this is, the comments made after a line of text should have too espaces before the <code>#</code> character.</p>
